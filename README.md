BugMeNot Scraper

This is a project for CMU's 18-732 Network Security class. It's not too fancy,
just a simple script to parse BugMeNot on some of the top sites, according to
Alexa, for usernames, passwords, and success rates of the accounts. I plan to run this script
reguarly to monitor for new accounts as well as track fluctuations in success rates.

Hopefully they don't mind me spidering over their site, and I'm gonna do my best
to prevent any sort of DoS-type actions.
